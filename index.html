  <h2>Is This Really Education?</h2>
  <p class="article-meta">January 8, 2026</p>
  
  <div class="article-body">
    <p>Right now, I am sitting here in a physics class. The teacher has been talking for over 40 minutes, but none of the students, including me, seem to care about what he is saying.</p>
<p>None of us wants to be in this class, and we&#39;re clearly not interested. Yet somehow, we&#39;ve been placed here, either by our parents or by society.</p>
<p>And I don&#39;t think this is just happening here in Japan, I believe it&#39;s happening in many countries around the world. The education system is broken and outdated.</p>
<p>The other day, I saw a student at our school who didn&#39;t even know how to use ChatGPT. Why? Because we&#39;re not being taught about tools like that.</p>
<p>Sometimes I wonder: What if schools taught things like coding, content creation, AI, and communication skills?</p>
<p>So the real question is: For how long will education continue like this?</p>

  <div class="article-body">
    <p>Simplicity is not the absence of complexity. It is the result of thoughtful reduction. Every element that remains has earned its place.</p>
<p>The temptation is always to add more. Another feature, another option, another layer of abstraction. But each addition carries weight.</p>
<p>The best interfaces disappear. They become invisible, allowing the content to speak.</p>

    <p>Quiet software doesn&#39;t demand attention. It doesn&#39;t notify, badge, or interrupt. It waits until you need it.</p>
<p>Most software today is loud. It wants engagement, retention, daily active users. It measures success by how much of your time it captures.</p>
<p>Quiet software measures success differently. By how little it intrudes. By how quickly it gets out of your way.</p>

I learned about so many things from this book such as recism, social morals and standard of 1900s. I found out about the history of 'nigga' or 'nigger' and i was stunned about people's behevior with these colored poeple. As I've been aware of the racial issues going on in Usa throughout these years, I did not know it was that serious back then. Everyone had this idea that crime = black person. White people were inoccent no matter what they did and black were guilty for no reason. There were people, hating on Adolf hittler for mistreating and punshing the jews, while they were doing the same with black poeple in their town.</p>

It taught me about the importance of little actions taken daily with no excuse and their impact on our lifes over a long period of time. I learned how to start a new habit and end the bad ones by using various techniques and methods such as habit stacking, understanding the cue of your habits and eliminating it from your environment. As a summary, it says design your environment in a way you can accomplish your habits unconsciously without any effort. For example, you need to go for a run every morning, therefore in order to do this action unconsciously you can do things like putting your running shoes in your room where you can see it or if you want to read a book every evening, you can put your book in your bed during the day so whenever you enter your room at the evening you can see it right away and then it's very unlikely that you will neglect and do not do that action.</p>
