  - name: working on
    items:
      - name: this site
        desc: Building an interactive terminal-style personal site. Plain HTML, CSS, and minimal JavaScript. No frameworks, no build tools.
      - name: writing more
        desc: Short notes, longer essays, whatever comes. Trying to publish regularly and think in public.
      - name: personal projects
        desc: Taking a break from client work to focus on what interests me. Building tools I want to use.
  - name: reading
    items:
      - name: Four Thousand Weeks
        status: finished
        desc: Oliver Burkeman on time management and mortality. Still thinking about the idea that we'll never "clear the decks" — there will always be more to do than time allows.
      - name: Designing Calm Technology
        status: in progress
        desc: Amber Case on technology that respects human attention. The idea of "calm" as a design principle resonates deeply.
  - name: thinking
    items:
      - name: productivity vs meaning
        desc: Is getting more done the goal? Or is it about doing the right things? The hustle culture vs. slow living debate.
      - name: how tools shape thought
        desc: The medium is the message. A notes app that's fast encourages different thinking than one that's slow. What do my tools optimize for?
      - name: what "enough" means
        desc: When do you have enough money, enough stuff, enough success? Most people never define this, so they never reach it.
