Quiet software doesn't demand attention. It doesn't notify, badge, or interrupt. It waits until you need it.

Most software today is loud. It wants engagement, retention, daily active users. It measures success by how much of your time it captures.

Quiet software measures success differently. By how little it intrudes. By how quickly it gets out of your way.
