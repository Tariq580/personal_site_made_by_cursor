title: Is This Really Education?

Right now, I am sitting here in a physics class. The teacher has been talking for over 40 minutes, but none of the students, including me, seem to care about what he is saying.

None of us wants to be in this class, and we're clearly not interested. Yet somehow, we've been placed here, either by our parents or by society.

And I don't think this is just happening here in Japan, I believe it's happening in many countries around the world. The education system is broken and outdated.

The other day, I saw a student at our school who didn't even know how to use ChatGPT. Why? Because we're not being taught about tools like that.

Sometimes I wonder: What if schools taught things like coding, content creation, AI, and communication skills?

So the real question is: For how long will education continue like this?
