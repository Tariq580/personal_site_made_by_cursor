      - name: Reading Tracker
        status: paused
        desc: Started building a web app to track books read. Halfway through, realized a simple text file does everything I need. Sometimes the best code is no code.

    items:
      - name: Habit Tracker
        status: abandoned
        desc: Scope crept from "simple checkboxes" to "full analytics dashboard." Motivation dropped. Classic second-system effect. Learned - start smaller, ship faster.

    items:
      - name: Minimal CSS Framework
        desc: CSS framework with no classes. Just semantic HTML that looks good by default. Exploring how far you can get without utility classes.
      - name: Static Site Search

      - name: CSS-Only Dark Mode
        desc: Dark mode toggle using only CSS and the :checked pseudo-class. No JavaScript. Persists via localStorage with a tiny inline script.

    items:
      - name: Local-first sync system
        status: exploring
        desc: Sync plain text files across devices without a cloud service. Peer-to-peer, encrypted, no accounts. Like Syncthing but simpler.
      - name: Minimal email client
        status: sketching
        desc: Text-based interface to Gmail/Fastmail APIs. Keyboard-driven. No HTML emails, just plain text. For people who want email to be boring again.

        status: someday
        desc: Just text. No formatting buttons, no word count, no AI suggestions. A blank page that saves automatically.
